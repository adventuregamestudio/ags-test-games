// Test EngineRender Module Header
//
// This module's purpose is to test engine's render, as much as possible
// from the script. The objects and sprites may be tested on their own, but
// engine may have mistakes in the drawing routine, which will not be reflected
// in game object states.
// The only available method of testing engine's render result at the moment
// is by taking screenshots and analysing their contents.
